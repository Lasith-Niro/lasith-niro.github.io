This game was designed to improve the **programming capability of students** who are new to computer programming.  One of the difficulties in computer programming is that the students have to precisely write the code.  If there is a syntax error, the program does not work.  This problem is avoided in this game by allowing dragging partly written  code segments dropping onto the programming window.  This allows learners to focus more on the semantic of the code instead of the syntax.  

The challenge is to construct a programming code such that by following the steps in the constructed programming code, a player could move from the current place to the target place.  The target code is given in the challenge.  There are two type of code segments to be used in constructing the programming code.  The first category is called the compulsory code and the other is optional code.All code segments in the compulsory category must be used in conducting the programming code.  On the other hand, one or more code in the optional category might be used in constructing the programming code.  The main reason for introducing two sets of codes is to compel a player to use compulsory code segments.  This decision was taken to compel a player to use every important programming concepts.  In a challenge, two sets of both kinds of code are given together with the target place.  A player can take the token to the finish position by successfully answering the challenges.
