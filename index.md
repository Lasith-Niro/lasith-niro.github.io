I am a Ph.D. candidate under the supervision of Dr. James. D. Carswell at the Technological University Dublin (aka. `TU Dublin`). My research studies focus on **Geographic Information Systems** and Deep Learning.  I have a broad interest in solving real-world problems using Machine Learning and Deep Learning.  As a result, currently, I'm conducting series of experiments to automate the OpenStreetMap updating process.

#### Education:
Ph.D. (Expected 2023), Technological University Dublin, Dublin, Ireland


B.Sc. (2018), University of Colombo School of Computing, Colombo, Sri Lanka
